- ‚úÖ **Encapsulation** ‚Äî Private fields with public accessors (getters/setters)
- ‚úÖ **Inheritance** ‚Äî `User` superclass with subclasses for different roles
- ‚úÖ **Polymorphism** ‚Äî Overridden `accessMenu()` for role-specific UI
- ‚úÖ **Abstraction** ‚Äî Abstract classes/interfaces like `PdfGenerator`
- ‚úÖ **Constructor Overloading**, **Composition**, **Association**, **Aggregation**, and **Exception Handling** implemented throughout

## Conclusion

- Reducing manual errors
- Improving internal coordination
- Supporting data-driven decisions via reports

While effective, its dependency on accurate data input and basic security measures should be noted for real-world deployment.
